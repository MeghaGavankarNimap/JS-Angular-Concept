angular change detection use zone js library.
budle size is large as there is zone js library has increased.

signals :There is no automatic change detection.as we tell angular for data changes.
Angular updates only part of UI where data(signals) are used.
advantage:full control,better performance,smaller budle size.

signals hae 3 methods to change value.update,mutate,set.
update will take 1 callback function compulsory.and will take oldvalue by deafult.
set does not take function ,insted it takes new value.
mutate is used to edit the existig vakue.syntax is same as update.{mutate has get removed form angular 17}
pildavlu.push cant be used with update .it can be only used with mutate.
signal(here value cal be boolean,[],{},number)

math.random only takes element so here i can use spread operator.
